## MicroHack Introduction

### What is Azure Arc for Kubernetes?

Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes allows you to attach Kubernetes clusters running anywhere so that you can manage and configure them in Azure. By managing all of your Kubernetes resources in a single control plane, you can enable a more consistent development and operation experience, helping you run cloud-native apps anywhere and on any Kubernetes platform.

Once your Kubernetes clusters are connected to Azure, you can:

- View all connected Kubernetes clusters for inventory, grouping, and tagging, along with your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters.

- Configure clusters and deploy applications using GitOps-based configuration management.

- View and monitor your clusters using Azure Monitor for containers.

- Enforce threat protection using Microsoft Defender for Kubernetes.

- Ensure governance through applying policies with Azure Policy for Kubernetes.

- Grant access and connect to your Kubernetes clusters from anywhere, and manage access by using Azure role-based access control (RBAC) on your cluster.

- Deploy machine learning workloads using Azure Machine Learning for Kubernetes clusters.

- Deploy and manage Kubernetes applications from Azure Marketplace.

- Deploy Azure PaaS services that allow you to take advantage of specific hardware, comply with data residency requirements, or enable new scenarios. Examples of services include:

    - Azure Arc-enabled data services
    - Azure Machine Learning for Kubernetes clusters
    - Workload Orchestration
    - Event Grid on Kubernetes
    - App Services on Azure Arc
    - Open Service Mesh
