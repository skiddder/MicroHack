## Challenge 1 - Onboarding your Kubernetes Cluster

### Goal
In challenge 1 you will connect/onboard your existing K8s cluster to Azure Arc. 

### Actions
* Verify all prerequisites are in place
  * Resource Providers
  * Azure CLI extensions
  * Resource group (Name: mh-arc-k8s-<xy>)
  * Connectivity to required Azure endpoints
* Deploy the Azure Arc agent pods to your k8s cluster
* Assign permissions to view k8s resources in the Azure portal

### Success Criteria
* Your k8s cluster appears in the Azure portal under Azure Arc > Infrastructure > Kubernetes clusters and is in status "Connected". Which arc agent version is running?
* In the Azure portal below Kubernetes resources > Workloads you can see all deployments and pods running on your cluster. What arc-specific namespaces were deployed during onboarding?
